I published 'BoothCMS' version 0.4.2. It contains these updates:

* Update content parse process to consider three dashes(`---`) as delimiter string([#14](https://github.com/DBC-Works/BoothCMS/issues/14))
    * If you want to check the content preview with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), set file extension to '.md' and use three dashes(`---`) as a delimiter string instead of three dots(`...`)
* Add '[Review](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/review-snippet)' structured data template
    * Support types are `Book` and `Thing`
