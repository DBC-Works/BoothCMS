I published 'BoothCMS' version 0.5.0. It contains these updates:

* Add `ReleaseTime` header support([#15](https://github.com/DBC-Works/BoothCMS/issues/15))
    * The content can't be accessed when the date and time of this header is in the future
* Correct structured data template
* Correct document typo
* Change testing framework from [pear(`run-tests`)](https://pear.php.net/manual/en/guide.users.commandline.commands.php) to [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/ja/latest/#)
